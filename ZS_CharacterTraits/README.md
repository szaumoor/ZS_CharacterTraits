# ZS_CharacterTraits
## Introduction

This mod is an attempt at making creating a new character an even more unique experience by inserting things that would normally be abstracted away from your character and their characteristics. Such as:

- What if your character was a psychopath?
- What if your character was autistic?
- What if your character was exceptionally good at learning?
- What if your character had an unusually small frame compared to the baseline of their race/sex?

The follow-up question is: what would those traits imply in terms of gameplay?

This mod is _by no means_ an attempt at being perfectly accurate describing any of those particular conditions or states of being, so please don't take offense. Though feel free to offer feedback on what might be a better representation thereof.

It does, nonetheless, inject a way of decreasing the feeling that your character is another instance of a blueprint, and it would match quite well

## Components

### 1. Install all character traits

This is the main and only component of the mod. This feat selection will be added automatically to every created character. You'll be given a list of spells inside the innate abilities button, which will allow you to take between 0 and 2 traits from each category. There will be a spell that clearly defines that you want no trait, as well. Either way, casting the spells will delete them forever from your selection.

These traits are meant to be taken at level 1. They're your personal peculiarities, in the same way that, for example, Haer'Dalis is peculiar because he can have 2 pips in long swords and short swords despite his kit not allowing it, just to give an example.

## Compatibility and issues

Probably nothing will cause compatibility issues unless someone else modifies CHARBASE.CRE and wipes out the innate spell selection, which would be, in any event, an awful way to work.

But do report if something is found.
